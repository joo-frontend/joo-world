                                You will see video ads as well as display ads. Most of our ads appear on

                                you can find out more information on the content or brand being

                                Some tile ads appear in other areas of your TV, for example in the main
                                Apps section. Display ads are positioned throughout the smart TV

                                so you can easily identify them.

                        Most TVs are shared devices in a household, with multiple members watching content.<br>
                        Different members in the household have different tastes. Some people love live sports, while others enjoy action movies.<br>
                        Some prefer binge-watching sci-fi series on-demand, while others prefer one-off comedy shows and documentaries. 
                        There might be a gamer in the house or even a family tuned-in to cartoons.
                    </p>
                    <p class="contents_desc">
                        TV data we use for interest-based advertisement is based on the shared viewing experiences of the entire household. 
                        As a result, you might see ads based on another household member’s interests.<br>
                        This is because we do not identify or use data from any individual person using the TV.

                        If you have opted-in to interest-based advertising, our aim is to show you relevant ads so you may discover new content or learn 
                        more about a product. We use viewing behavior and device usage data that reflects your household interests, combined with data 
                        from trusted third-party providers.  For advertising across connected devices, Samsung uses data from third-party websites.
                        All of this is done at the household level.

                    <p class="contents_desc">
                        Samsung will use data associated with your smart TV’s unique Advertising ID (TIFA) and its Internet Protocol (IP) address to enable 
                        interest-based advertising on computers, smartphones, or tablets. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="contents_desc">
                        For example, if you have tuned into superhero movies on your smart TV, an advertiser for a new superhero movie or TV series might 
                        target advertising to you when you are on a computer, smartphone, or tablet that has been connected to the same IP address. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="contents_desc">
                        As another example, if you have shopped for football equipment on your laptop, an advertiser might target advertising to you on 
                        your smart TV for tickets to football games or other sports equipment.

                        Interest-based advertisements are only delivered to large groups of devices. Advertisers only know they are reaching a large group of people who might be interested in what they are offering.

                        Once ads are delivered, we share insights reports with advertisers, so they can understand how their ads are performing. Samsung does not supply to advertisers any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, or email.
